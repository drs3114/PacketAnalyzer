# PacketAnalyzer
A program to analyze a network packet and provide human readable information regarding the packet.

This project consists of 

	Pkt.java
	Pktanalyzer.java
	PktType.java
	
To Run the program, follow these steps.

	1. Compile all the java files.
	2. Run Pktanalyzer using the command
		java Pktanalyzer <filename>
		Here, file name is the name of the packet stored in a binary file.
		
While this project currently decodes the ICMP, TCP and UDP for now, other protocols will be updated soon enough.

Until then,
Cheers!
